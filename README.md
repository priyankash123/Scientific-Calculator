# Scientific-Calculator
This is a Scientific Calculator built using C++. It performs a wide range of mathematical operations, ranging from basic arithmetic to advanced functions such as trigonometry, logarithms, and factorial calculations.

# Features
- Basic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Power and Roots: Calculate powers, square roots, and cube roots.
- Logarithmic Functions: Natural log (ln), Log base 10
- Factorial & Permutation: Computes factorials, permutations (nPr), and combinations (nCr).
- Trigonometric Functions: Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Inverse Trigonometric functions.
- Exponential & Floor Functions: Exponentials, floor values, and rounding operations.
- Angle Conversion: Convert degrees to radians and radians to degrees.
- Absolute Values: Compute the absolute value of a number.
- Error Handling: Handles edge cases like division by zero and negative factorial input.

# How It Works
- The user is prompted to enter two operands and selects the desired operation from a list of options.
- Based on the selected operation, the program performs the calculation and displays the result.
- The operations cover a wide range of mathematical functions suitable for scientific calculations.
